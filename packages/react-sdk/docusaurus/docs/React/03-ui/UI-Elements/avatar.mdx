![Preview of the Avatar component.](../../assets/03-ui/avatar-preview.jpg)

The `Avatar` element is generally used to show the image and/or name of participants of a video call.

Of course, it can also be used in any other circumstance that you like, for example in user lists, profiles, and much more.

### General usage

The way you can use the `Avatar` element in a react component is like this:

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export function AvatarExample(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <Avatar imageSrc="https://getstream.io/random_png/?id=stefan&name=stefan" />
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```

:::note
For the element to use the correct styling you need to take the following steps:

1. Add the dependency of the styling package: `yarn add @stream-io/video-styling`
2. Import the CSS file somewhere: `import '@stream-io/video-styling/dist/css/styles.css';`
3. A parent element of the `<Avatar>` element needs to have the class `str-video` attached, so e.g. `<div className='str-video'>`

:::

### Customization

The `Avatar` view offers three properties that you can set:

- `imageSrc`: `string?`
- `name`: `string?`
- `styles`: `CSSProperties & Record<string, string | number>`

All of them are optional but you can customize them to make the element look like you want.

The first option, `imageSrc`, is an image URL that you can hand to the element where it will try to show the image that is located where the URL points to.
In the case of an error, it will show a fallback element.

The second option, `name`, allows you to set a name for the `Avatar` that will be displayed below it (by default).

The third option, `styles`, gives you the option to write custom styling code for the component. This way you can make it look the way you want.

How all three properties can be set, is shown in the following example below:

```tsx
import { Avatar } from '@stream-io/video-react-sdk';

export function AvatarExample(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    // highlight-start
    <Avatar
      imageSrc="https://getstream.io/random_png/?id=stefan&name=stefan"
      name="Stefan"
      style={{ width: '20rem', height: '20rem' }}
    />
    // highlight-end
  );
}
```
